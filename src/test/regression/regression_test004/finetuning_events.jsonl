For example, as shown in\nFigure 5, a key event in golf may be the moment when the golf\nclub hits the ball (impact), and the motion before the golf club\nhits the ball can be considered as the phase of the golf club\napproaching the ball (swinging down). Note that all the\nframes in the period between two key events have the same\nphase label. Following the key event annotation of GolfDB,\nwe labeled our pseudo dataset with eight key events: address,\ntoe-up, mid-backswing, top, mid-downswing, impact, mid-\nfollow-through, and \ufb01nish. Phases were labeled between\nevery two key events, for a total of seven phases.\nThe phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy was per frame phase\nclassi\ufb01cation. To calculate the accuracy, we \ufb01rst used the\nencoders of our TCC networks to extract latent vectors.\nWe then trained a simple classi\ufb01er on the latent vectors to\npredict the labeled phases. The classi\ufb01er was trained under\nseveral conditions by changing the percentage of the given\nlabeled data. After the classi\ufb01er was trained, we used all\nlabeled data to calculate the phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy.\nIn general, the larger the size of the given labeled data, the\nhigher the accuracy of the classi\ufb01er.\nTo explore more speci\ufb01cally the effectiveness of the net-\nwork in detecting discrepant motion, we investigated whether\nthe distance in the latent space could represent the discrep-\nancy between two input sequences by computing Pearson\u2019s\ncorrelation coef\ufb01cient. Because 3D poses varied for differ-\nent camera views, we could not directly compare the two\nhuman poses using the results from the 3d pose estimator.\nThus, we applied Procrustes analysis to align the two human\nposes to ensure that they were seen from the same camera\ndirection. In our experiment, we compared the distance in the\nlatent space with the mean per joint point error (MPJPE) and\nmeasured the Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient \u03c1:\n\u03c1D,E=cov(D, E)\n\u03c3D\u03c3E(6)\nwhere covis the covariance; Dis the distance in the latent\nspace; Eis the MPJPE; and \u03c3Dand\u03c3Eare the standard\ndeviations of DandE.\nV.

This might be explained by\nthe fact that the network focused not only on human motion\nbut also on other motion features. In this case, the golf club\u2019s\nmovement, which was also critical during the swing, might\nbe the main factor causing the enormous distance in the latent\nspace. This led us to the following quantitative studies, where\nwe conducted statistical tests to examine the accuracy of the\nsynchronization and the correlation between the latent space\nand joint difference under various conditions.\nB. PHASE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY\nIn this quantitative study, we discovered that the previous\nTCC implementation had limited precision in terms of syn-\nchronization. As our hypothesis suggests, synchronization\nquality might be in\ufb02uenced by various background informa-\ntion and other movements, such as the golf club\u2019s and human\nshadow\u2019s motions. When the background was removed, a sig-\nni\ufb01cant increase in the accuracy of the V-TCC model was\nobserved. This result supported our hypothesis that infor-\nmation outside the human region would affect alignment.Various types of information from the background, the\nmovement of human shadows, and the motion of properties\ncontrolled by a human might be learned as features by the net-\nwork, thus affecting the accuracy of the analysis. Because of\nthe signi\ufb01cant superiority of the without-background version,\nwe considered it necessary to apply background subtraction\nbefore synchronization when building applications for real\nusage.\nNext, considering the skeleton version, both S-TCC and\nSA-TCC outperformed V-TCC under all conditions. Given\nonly 10% of the labeled data, both S-TCC and SA-TCC\nachieved a phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy of over 90%. This\nmight be explained by the fact that the skeleton version\nhad more compressed and precise information than the\nvideo version, where the color information might be noisy.\nAdditionally, 3D poses represented high-level human fea-\ntures. Therefore, the features outside the human region were\nremoved when retrieving 3D human poses, resulting in more\nprecise accuracy for further golf swing analysis. Note that the\nskeleton data were the estimated results from the video data,\nand the estimation could not be perfect for every human pose.\nDespite imperfect skeleton inputs, the S-TCC and SA-TCC\nnetworks outperformed V-TCC. This result suggested that we\ncould use the skeleton version for more precise implementa-\ntion in actual usage.\nFinally, comparing the two skeleton version mod-\nels, S-TCC performed better than SA-TCC under most\nconditions. However, SA-TCC remained competitive in some\ncircumstances (better than S-TCC with 10% labeled data).\nThis led to the following correlation test, in which we dis-\ncussed the ability of the networks to detect discrepancies\nbetween two motions.\nC. CORRELATION\nDiscussing the correlation test, as shown in Figure 7,\nwe observed a correlation between the distance in the latent\nspace and the MPJPE. While the distribution of the data pairs\nseemed to be scattered, a Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient of\nover 0.69 showed the potential of the network to distinguish\nwhether the difference between the two motions was small\nor large. However, as discussed in the case study section,\nin some circumstances, the network failed to detect discrepant\n106292 VOLUME 10, 2022\n\npage_label: 106291\nfile_name: AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nFor video inputs, a 0.69 Pearson\u2019s correla-\ntion coef\ufb01cient was measured for regular video, and a\n0.72 Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient was obtained when the\nbackground was removed (Figure 7). For skeleton inputs,\nan over 0.76 Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient was found\nwhen using the SA-TCC; however, the lowest Pearson\u2019s cor-\nrelation coef\ufb01cient with 0.51 was obtained from the S-TCC\n(Figure 8).\nD. MOTION INTERPOLATION\nFor the qualitative results, we computed and visualized the\nintermediate human pose between a pair of human poses\nconsidering the following three circumstances:\n\u2022The two poses were from a single person. The two poses\nwere in different phases (Figure 9(a)).\n\u2022The two poses were from different individuals. The two\nposes were in the same phase (Figure 9(b)).\n\u2022The two poses were from different individuals. The two\nposes were in different phases (Figure 9(c)).\nVI. DISCUSSION\nA. CASE STUDY\nIn our early case study, we observed that in most cases, when\nthe distance in the latent space was small, the difference\nbetween the two 3D poses was small(Figure 6c). On the\nother hand, when the distance was considerable, the 3D poses\nshowed more differences(Figure 6b, d). This suggested that\nthe network could distinguish between beginners and profes-\nsionals. Thus, we can use this feature to retrieve motion fea-\ntures that help users target the key moves they have to correct.\nHowever, as depicted in Figure 6(a), the distance in the latent\nspace remained large even in certain circumstances where the\nVOLUME 10, 2022 106291\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What Pearson's correlation coefficient was obtained for skeleton inputs using the SA-TCC?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Pearson's correlation coefficient obtained for skeleton inputs using the SA-TCC was over 0.76."}]}

Liao et al.: AI Golf: Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training\nindividuals, we must align the motions to make them com-\nparable. A conventional method for aligning two temporal\nsequences is dynamic time warping (DTW), which was intro-\nduced by Berndt and Clifford [18]. In this method, every\nindex in a sequence is matched with one or more indices from\nanother sequence, and the mapping of the indices from the\n\ufb01rst sequence to the other sequences must be monotonically\nincreasing. The DTW concept has been introduced in several\ndomains. For example, Ikeda et al. [19] proposed a real-time\ngolf swing projecting system that simultaneously visualized\nprofessional and user forms with matched timing. To align\nthe two motions in real-time, they measured the DTW only\nover a short period and penalized the previous cost value at\na later time. Halperin et al. [20] utilized the concept of DTW\nin speech and presented an audio-to-video alignment method\nfor matching speech-to-lip movements.\nOn the other hand, self-supervised neural networks have\nrecently been developed to tackle video alignment tasks\nusing the latent space representation [12], [21], [22]. In this\napproach, an embedder is used to compress input videos\ninto a latent space. After the embedding process, a loss is\ndesigned to \ufb01nd correspondences through time in the latent\nspace, thus encouraging the network to learn a latent space\nwhere similar motions should appear to be close. This method\nhelps synchronize high complexity temporal sequences, such\nas videos. In this study, we base the loss of our network on the\ntemporal cycle-consistency loss used by Dwibedi et al. [12],\nbut apply DTW along with the loss for smooth temporal\nmatching.\nC. DISCREPANCY DETECTION\nBy comparing the two synchronized motions, we can deter-\nmine the difference between them in terms of human pos-\ntures. In early studies, abnormal detection referred mainly\nto \ufb01nding patterns in data that did not match the expected\nbehavior [25]. Recently, two methods have been proposed for\ndetecting abnormalities In the \ufb01rst approach, abnormal infor-\nmation is referred to as prior knowledge. For example, Parra-\nDominguez et al. [26] trained a binary classi\ufb01er on annotated\ndata to determine whether abnormal events occurred during\na stair descent. In the second approach to abnormal detec-\ntion, abnormal information is not provided in advance. The\nresearch group of Nater et al. [27] proposed an unsupervised\nlearning method for learning normal human behavior. They\nused a hierarchical representation of the appearance and\naction level of regular movements to detect abnormal events.\nWhile a network may be trained to detect abnormal events,\nsuch as falling to the ground, we focus on whether a neural\nnetwork can be trained to automatically detect \ufb01ne-grained\ndifferences between two regular motions. We call this detec-\ntion of the \ufb01ne-grained difference discrepancy detection. The\nmost relevant of these studies is that of Abati et al. [28]. They\ndesigned a deep autoencoder with a parametric estimator\nthat learned a probability distribution from the latent space\nto detect discrepancies. The encoder effectively remembered\nstandard samples and could distinguish between normal and\nFIGURE 1. System overview. Xis the input motion sequence and Yis the\noutput human poses restored from the latent space.\nabnormal images. However, although the network could eas-\nily detect surprise samples, \ufb01ne-grained differences among\nstandard samples were not discussed. In addition to image-\nbased methods, recent studies have focused on systems that\nuse 3D human pose information [29], [30]. In this study,\nwe apply discrepancy detection to both videos and 3D\nhuman poses and discuss the ability of the system to detect\n\ufb01ne-grained differences between two input motions.\nIII. METHODS\nThis study aims to create a system that captures user motions\nand provides \ufb01ne-grained feedback to improve users\u2019 forms\nby comparing their motions with those of professionals.\n\npage_label: 106288\nfile_name: AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nTo achieve the goal of building such an application, the\nmethod proposed in this study is to \ufb01rst train a neural network\nwith professionals\u2019 motion data. After training the network,\nthe system compresses the user motions through the network\ninto a latent space and compares their motions with those of\nprofessionals in the latent space. Figure 1 shows an overview\nof the proposed system. The work\ufb02ow of the approach is\ndivided into three parts: motion synchronization, motion dis-\ncrepancy detection, and motion manipulation. The system\n\ufb01rst receives two motion inputs X1andX2and uses encoder\nEto embed the input motions into the latent space, where the\ntwo motions are represented as L1andL2. The encoder is\ntrained to learn a latent space in which similar motions appear\nto be close.\nNext, using the learned latent space, the motion synchro-\nnizer MSmatches the timing of the two motions in the\nlatent space by measuring the Euclidean distance between\nL1andL2. The motion discrepancy detector then captures\nthe two synchronized latent vectors V1andV2, measures the\ndifference between them, and passes a distance vector D12to\nthe motion manipulator MM.\nFinally, the MM integrates V1,V2, and D12to specify\nthe key frames where large differences occur and create an\nintermediate latent vector Vinter. The system uses decoder D\nto restore the intermediate human poses Yfrom Vinterfor\nusers to gradually improve their motion forms.\nA. MOTION SYNCHRONIZER: ALIGNING MOTION\nSEQUENCES WITH DIFFERENT TIMING\nFor motion synchronization, we aim to design a network\nthat learns a latent space that shows motion similarity.\nA common way to achieve this is by constructing an\nautoencoder and decoder, whose input and output are the\nsame motions. On the other hand, previous studies have\n106288 VOLUME 10, 2022\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What method is used in this study to align two temporal sequences in order to make them comparable?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The method used in this study to align two temporal sequences and make them comparable is dynamic time warping (DTW)."}]}

Fur-\nthermore, we visualized the attention maps along with the\nself-attention module to demonstrate the importance of each\nbody part (Figure 10). This may be a clue for discovering\nbody parts that should be focused on and what can be ignored.\nTo go a step further, this might indicate the importance of the\nbody parts that trainees should follow to revise their poses\noptimally. In the future, we plan to conduct user studies to\nevaluate the training effectiveness of the proposed system\nand determine whether the crucial points shown by the atten-\ntion maps can be used in real training scenarios. Moreover,\nwe consider that using a high-quality motion capture sys-\ntem can enhance the solidity of the proposed system with\nhigh-precision human poses despite the high speed of motion,\nsuch as golf swings.\nAs this work focuses on proposing a novel \ufb02ow for con-\nstructing a sports analysis tool, and because user studies may\nvary from domain to domain and are \ufb02exible for the system\ndesigner, further user studies evaluating the proposed sys-\ntem\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency have not been addressed in practice. As pre-\nviously mentioned, there are many ways to design a proper\nway to provide feedback to users for training. Related works\nthat use multi-modal feedback to alert users when performing\nthe wrong way compared to professionals have shown their\nsigni\ufb01cance during training. In the future, we plan to combine\nour approach with other feedback systems and evaluate the\neffectiveness of the system. Furthermore, we plan to apply the\nproposed approach to other sports and skill training processes\nto explore the generality of the proposed method.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nWe propose a golf swing analysis tool that uses neural net-\nworks to help users intuitively understand the difference\nbetween themselves and professional players. We divide our\nwork into three parts: synchronization, discrepancy detec-\ntion, and manipulation. First, the motion synchronizer aligns\nmotions with different phases and timings. The experi-\nment shows that our implementation using skeleton inputs\ncan achieve a better performance than state-of-the-art video\nimplementations.\nSecond, using the proposed networks, we use a motion\ndiscrepancy detector to \ufb01nd \ufb01ne-grained differences between\ngolf swings in the latent space. By applying comparative anal-\nysis, such as comparing 3D human poses in those detected\nframes, we conclude that the motion discrepancy detector can\ndistinguish whether the difference between the two motions is\nsmall or large. The proposed SA-TCC network outperforms\nthe previous TCC network in terms of phase classi\ufb01cation\naccuracy and has the best ability to show the correlation\nbetween the distance in the latent space and the MPJPE.\nThird, based on the synchronization and discrepancy detec-\ntion results, we introduce a decoder structure called a motionmanipulator to restore motion from the latent space. The\nrestoration results suggest that the network can retrieve inter-\nmediate human poses between two motions that do not\nexist in the original dataset. Furthermore, instead of teach-\ning beginners directly about professional forms, the motion\nmanipulator can provide them with an intermediate pose that\nis more acceptable for beginners to start with.\nFinally, with the above three main contributions of this\nwork, we create an application for analyzing and visualiz-\ning the discrepancy between two input golf swing motions.\nFor user interaction, users can quickly grasp the difference\nbetween their swings and those of various experts during\nself-training. In addition, by understanding the continuous\nchanges step-by-step between the two selected human poses,\nwe aim to help users ef\ufb01ciently learn an ideal form in a\ngradual manner instead of directly imitating ideal motion.\nUsing the proposed system, users can choose an ideal form\nto imitate and learn to play sports without the help of coaches\nduring self-training. We intend to re\ufb01ne the proposed pro-\ntotype application and conduct user studies to investigate its\neffectiveness.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What are the three main contributions of the proposed golf swing analysis tool?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The three main contributions of the proposed golf swing analysis tool are the motion synchronizer, the motion discrepancy detector, and the motion manipulator.

After training the network,\nthe system compresses the user motions through the network\ninto a latent space and compares their motions with those of\nprofessionals in the latent space. Figure 1 shows an overview\nof the proposed system. The work\ufb02ow of the approach is\ndivided into three parts: motion synchronization, motion dis-\ncrepancy detection, and motion manipulation. The system\n\ufb01rst receives two motion inputs X1andX2and uses encoder\nEto embed the input motions into the latent space, where the\ntwo motions are represented as L1andL2. The encoder is\ntrained to learn a latent space in which similar motions appear\nto be close.\nNext, using the learned latent space, the motion synchro-\nnizer MSmatches the timing of the two motions in the\nlatent space by measuring the Euclidean distance between\nL1andL2. The motion discrepancy detector then captures\nthe two synchronized latent vectors V1andV2, measures the\ndifference between them, and passes a distance vector D12to\nthe motion manipulator MM.\nFinally, the MM integrates V1,V2, and D12to specify\nthe key frames where large differences occur and create an\nintermediate latent vector Vinter. The system uses decoder D\nto restore the intermediate human poses Yfrom Vinterfor\nusers to gradually improve their motion forms.\nA. MOTION SYNCHRONIZER: ALIGNING MOTION\nSEQUENCES WITH DIFFERENT TIMING\nFor motion synchronization, we aim to design a network\nthat learns a latent space that shows motion similarity.\nA common way to achieve this is by constructing an\nautoencoder and decoder, whose input and output are the\nsame motions.

CASE STUDY\nIn our early case study, we observed that in most cases, when\nthe distance in the latent space was small, the difference\nbetween the two 3D poses was small(Figure 6c). On the\nother hand, when the distance was considerable, the 3D poses\nshowed more differences(Figure 6b, d). This suggested that\nthe network could distinguish between beginners and profes-\nsionals. Thus, we can use this feature to retrieve motion fea-\ntures that help users target the key moves they have to correct.\nHowever, as depicted in Figure 6(a), the distance in the latent\nspace remained large even in certain circumstances where the\nVOLUME 10, 2022 106291\n\npage_label: 106292\nfile_name: AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nC.-C.

The red line in the\ngraph indicates the threshold for discrepancy detection. The colored skeleton and black skeleton indicate the user\u2019s pose and expert\u2019s pose,\nrespectively. The density and radius of red spheres indicate the degree of joint position difference between the two skeletons.\nFIGURE 7. Pearson\u2019s correlation test for V-TCC. Left: normal videos. Right:\nvideos without background.\nFIGURE 8. Pearson\u2019s correlation test with skeleton input. Left: S-TCC.\nRight: SA-TCC.\njoint difference was negligible. This might be explained by\nthe fact that the network focused not only on human motion\nbut also on other motion features. In this case, the golf club\u2019s\nmovement, which was also critical during the swing, might\nbe the main factor causing the enormous distance in the latent\nspace. This led us to the following quantitative studies, where\nwe conducted statistical tests to examine the accuracy of the\nsynchronization and the correlation between the latent space\nand joint difference under various conditions.\nB. PHASE CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY\nIn this quantitative study, we discovered that the previous\nTCC implementation had limited precision in terms of syn-\nchronization. As our hypothesis suggests, synchronization\nquality might be in\ufb02uenced by various background informa-\ntion and other movements, such as the golf club\u2019s and human\nshadow\u2019s motions. When the background was removed, a sig-\nni\ufb01cant increase in the accuracy of the V-TCC model was\nobserved. This result supported our hypothesis that infor-\nmation outside the human region would affect alignment.Various types of information from the background, the\nmovement of human shadows, and the motion of properties\ncontrolled by a human might be learned as features by the net-\nwork, thus affecting the accuracy of the analysis. Because of\nthe signi\ufb01cant superiority of the without-background version,\nwe considered it necessary to apply background subtraction\nbefore synchronization when building applications for real\nusage.\nNext, considering the skeleton version, both S-TCC and\nSA-TCC outperformed V-TCC under all conditions. Given\nonly 10% of the labeled data, both S-TCC and SA-TCC\nachieved a phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy of over 90%. This\nmight be explained by the fact that the skeleton version\nhad more compressed and precise information than the\nvideo version, where the color information might be noisy.\nAdditionally, 3D poses represented high-level human fea-\ntures. Therefore, the features outside the human region were\nremoved when retrieving 3D human poses, resulting in more\nprecise accuracy for further golf swing analysis. Note that the\nskeleton data were the estimated results from the video data,\nand the estimation could not be perfect for every human pose.\nDespite imperfect skeleton inputs, the S-TCC and SA-TCC\nnetworks outperformed V-TCC. This result suggested that we\ncould use the skeleton version for more precise implementa-\ntion in actual usage.\nFinally, comparing the two skeleton version mod-\nels, S-TCC performed better than SA-TCC under most\nconditions. However, SA-TCC remained competitive in some\ncircumstances (better than S-TCC with 10% labeled data).\nThis led to the following correlation test, in which we dis-\ncussed the ability of the networks to detect discrepancies\nbetween two motions.\nC. CORRELATION\nDiscussing the correlation test, as shown in Figure 7,\nwe observed a correlation between the distance in the latent\nspace and the MPJPE. While the distribution of the data pairs\nseemed to be scattered, a Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient of\nover 0.69 showed the potential of the network to distinguish\nwhether the difference between the two motions was small\nor large. However, as discussed in the case study section,\nin some circumstances, the network failed to detect discrepant\n106292 VOLUME 10, 2022\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What was the result of the correlation test between the distance in the latent space and the MPJPE?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The correlation test between the distance in the latent space and the MPJPE showed a Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of over 0.69.

For example, as shown in\nFigure 5, a key event in golf may be the moment when the golf\nclub hits the ball (impact), and the motion before the golf club\nhits the ball can be considered as the phase of the golf club\napproaching the ball (swinging down). Note that all the\nframes in the period between two key events have the same\nphase label. Following the key event annotation of GolfDB,\nwe labeled our pseudo dataset with eight key events: address,\ntoe-up, mid-backswing, top, mid-downswing, impact, mid-\nfollow-through, and \ufb01nish. Phases were labeled between\nevery two key events, for a total of seven phases.\nThe phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy was per frame phase\nclassi\ufb01cation. To calculate the accuracy, we \ufb01rst used the\nencoders of our TCC networks to extract latent vectors.\nWe then trained a simple classi\ufb01er on the latent vectors to\npredict the labeled phases. The classi\ufb01er was trained under\nseveral conditions by changing the percentage of the given\nlabeled data. After the classi\ufb01er was trained, we used all\nlabeled data to calculate the phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy.\nIn general, the larger the size of the given labeled data, the\nhigher the accuracy of the classi\ufb01er.\nTo explore more speci\ufb01cally the effectiveness of the net-\nwork in detecting discrepant motion, we investigated whether\nthe distance in the latent space could represent the discrep-\nancy between two input sequences by computing Pearson\u2019s\ncorrelation coef\ufb01cient. Because 3D poses varied for differ-\nent camera views, we could not directly compare the two\nhuman poses using the results from the 3d pose estimator.\nThus, we applied Procrustes analysis to align the two human\nposes to ensure that they were seen from the same camera\ndirection.

In addition, instead of directly\nimitating the selected motion, users can gradually imitate\nintermediate human poses using a motion manipulator. Fur-\nthermore, we visualized the attention maps along with the\nself-attention module to demonstrate the importance of each\nbody part (Figure 10). This may be a clue for discovering\nbody parts that should be focused on and what can be ignored.\nTo go a step further, this might indicate the importance of the\nbody parts that trainees should follow to revise their poses\noptimally. In the future, we plan to conduct user studies to\nevaluate the training effectiveness of the proposed system\nand determine whether the crucial points shown by the atten-\ntion maps can be used in real training scenarios. Moreover,\nwe consider that using a high-quality motion capture sys-\ntem can enhance the solidity of the proposed system with\nhigh-precision human poses despite the high speed of motion,\nsuch as golf swings.\nAs this work focuses on proposing a novel \ufb02ow for con-\nstructing a sports analysis tool, and because user studies may\nvary from domain to domain and are \ufb02exible for the system\ndesigner, further user studies evaluating the proposed sys-\ntem\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency have not been addressed in practice. As pre-\nviously mentioned, there are many ways to design a proper\nway to provide feedback to users for training. Related works\nthat use multi-modal feedback to alert users when performing\nthe wrong way compared to professionals have shown their\nsigni\ufb01cance during training. In the future, we plan to combine\nour approach with other feedback systems and evaluate the\neffectiveness of the system. Furthermore, we plan to apply the\nproposed approach to other sports and skill training processes\nto explore the generality of the proposed method.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nWe propose a golf swing analysis tool that uses neural net-\nworks to help users intuitively understand the difference\nbetween themselves and professional players. We divide our\nwork into three parts: synchronization, discrepancy detec-\ntion, and manipulation. First, the motion synchronizer aligns\nmotions with different phases and timings. The experi-\nment shows that our implementation using skeleton inputs\ncan achieve a better performance than state-of-the-art video\nimplementations.\nSecond, using the proposed networks, we use a motion\ndiscrepancy detector to \ufb01nd \ufb01ne-grained differences between\ngolf swings in the latent space. By applying comparative anal-\nysis, such as comparing 3D human poses in those detected\nframes, we conclude that the motion discrepancy detector can\ndistinguish whether the difference between the two motions is\nsmall or large. The proposed SA-TCC network outperforms\nthe previous TCC network in terms of phase classi\ufb01cation\naccuracy and has the best ability to show the correlation\nbetween the distance in the latent space and the MPJPE.\nThird, based on the synchronization and discrepancy detec-\ntion results, we introduce a decoder structure called a motionmanipulator to restore motion from the latent space. The\nrestoration results suggest that the network can retrieve inter-\nmediate human poses between two motions that do not\nexist in the original dataset. Furthermore, instead of teach-\ning beginners directly about professional forms, the motion\nmanipulator can provide them with an intermediate pose that\nis more acceptable for beginners to start with.\nFinally, with the above three main contributions of this\nwork, we create an application for analyzing and visualiz-\ning the discrepancy between two input golf swing motions.\nFor user interaction, users can quickly grasp the difference\nbetween their swings and those of various experts during\nself-training. In addition, by understanding the continuous\nchanges step-by-step between the two selected human poses,\nwe aim to help users ef\ufb01ciently learn an ideal form in a\ngradual manner instead of directly imitating ideal motion.\nUsing the proposed system, users can choose an ideal form\nto imitate and learn to play sports without the help of coaches\nduring self-training. We intend to re\ufb01ne the proposed pro-\ntotype application and conduct user studies to investigate its\neffectiveness.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: Question: What is the purpose of the motion discrepancy detector in the AI Golf Swing Analysis Tool?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The motion discrepancy detector in the AI Golf Swing Analysis Tool is used to find fine-grained differences between golf swings in the latent space.

To retrieve the intermediate\nmotion between two points in the latent space, we train a\ndecoder using latent vectors to predict human poses that\nare the same as the inputs. In particular, we \ufb01rst input the\ntraining set data into the trained TCC network to obtain the\noutputs of the latent vectors. Next, using the latent vectors\nas inputs, we trained a simple decoder consisting of a single\nfully-connected layer to produce the outputs of the human\nposes. For the loss function LMSE, we take the mean square\nerror (MSE) between the output and input poses:\nLMSE=\u2211\ni||Yi\u2212Xi||2(4)\nwhere Xiis the ithjoint of the input human pose XandYiis\ntheithjoint of the output human pose Y.\nAfter training the motion decoder, we retrieve a new latent\nvector Vinterbetween the two timing-matched latent vectors\nusing linear interpolation:\nVinter=(1\u2212\u03b1)\u00d7V1+\u03b1\u00d7V2 (5)\nwhere V1andV2are the two latent vectors synchronized by\nthe motion synchronizer, and \u03b1\u22080.0,1.0 is the magnitude\nparameter. In the above formulation, by increasing the value\nof\u03b1, we can obtain a human pose whose latent vector is closer\ntoV2, and the restored human pose should ideally be more\nsimilar to the human poses generated from V2.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nTo evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the three mod-\nules introduced in the previous section, we collected golf\nswing data via the Internet and created a pseudo database\nconsisting of raw video data, without-background-video data,\nand 3D pose data (Figure 4). Next, we implemented three\nmodels of the network (V-TCC, S-TCC, and SA-TCC) uti-\nlizing TCC loss and conducted statistical analysis under four\ndifferent conditions:\n\u2022V-TCC using video inputs with backgrounds\nFIGURE 5.

Although the GolfDB provided\npreprocessed video clips for a frame size of 160 \u00d7160,\nwe rebuilt our pseudo dataset with high-resolution videos.\nIn addition to clean videos, we created another video dataset\nwithout background information. This was because, in our\nhypothesis, the background information, for example, the\nhuman shadow, might in\ufb02uence the alignment of the network.\nMoreover, the network might also learn the motion of props,\nsuch as golf clubs. We used Mask R-CNN [34], a generic\nobject detection and segmentation network, to detect the\nhuman body in a single image frame. We then removed the\nbackground pixels and left only the human body (Figure 4).\nB. 3D POSE DATASET\nTo conduct a more precise analysis of only human poses,\nwe created a new pseudo dataset consisting of 3D point\ndata of human body poses.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What are the three models of the network used in the experimental setup for golf swing analysis?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The three models of the network used in the experimental setup for golf swing analysis are V-TCC, S-TCC, and SA-TCC."}]}

However, it is dif\ufb01cult for beginners to specify\nthe keyframes on which they should focus and which part of the body they should correct because of\ninconsistent timing and lack of knowledge. In this study, a golf swing analysis tool using neural networks\nis proposed to address this gap. The proposed system compares two motion sequences and speci\ufb01es\nkeyframes in which signi\ufb01cant differences can be observed between the two motions. In addition, the system\nhelps users intuitively understand the differences between themselves and professional players by using\ninterpretable clues. The main challenge of this study is to target the \ufb01ne-grained differences between users\nand professionals that can be used for self-training. Moreover, the signi\ufb01cance of the proposed approach is\nthe use of an unsupervised learning method without prior knowledge and labeled data, which will bene\ufb01t\nfuture applications and research in other sports and skill training processes. In our approach, neural networks\nare \ufb01rst used to create a motion synchronizer to align motions with different phases and timing. Next,\na motion discrepancy detector is implemented to \ufb01nd \ufb01ne-grained differences between motions in latent\nspaces that are learned by the networks. Furthermore, we consider that learning intermediate motions may\nbe feasible for beginners because, in this way, they can gradually change their pose to match the ideal form.\nTherefore, based on the synchronization and discrepancy detection results, we utilize a decoder to restore\nthe intermediate human poses between two motions from the latent space. Finally, we suggest possible\napplications for analyzing and visualizing the discrepancy between the two input motions and interacting\nwith the users. With the proposed application, users can easily understand the differences between their\nmotions and those of various experts during self-training and learn how to improve their motions.\nINDEX TERMS Computer vision, machine learning, motor skill training, golf.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn sports, it is dif\ufb01cult for beginners to improve their skills\nwithout prior knowledge or assistance from coaches. As a\nconventional method, people go to lessons to meet experts\nand learn how to play in the proper form. However, in most\nsports, players spend considerable time training alone to\nachieve outstanding results in the \ufb01eld and retain exceptional\nbody conditions. Therefore, it is important to design and\nimplement an effective and accurate self-training process for\nsuch situations.\nIn the \ufb01eld of the acquisition of sports skills, one way\nto improve sports skills is to replicate professional players\u2019\nmotions.

To accelerate this process,\nmany systems have recently been developed to help users\nunderstand the movements of professionals [1], [2], [3], [4],\n[5]. However, in these previous works and systems, users may\nstruggle to re\ufb01ne their movement with no idea which timing\nof the whole motion, which parts of the body they should\nfocus on, or how they can change their body movements to\nget their form closer to that of professionals.\n\npage_label: 106294\nfile_name: AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nC.-C.

In addition, instead of directly\nimitating the selected motion, users can gradually imitate\nintermediate human poses using a motion manipulator. Fur-\nthermore, we visualized the attention maps along with the\nself-attention module to demonstrate the importance of each\nbody part (Figure 10). This may be a clue for discovering\nbody parts that should be focused on and what can be ignored.\nTo go a step further, this might indicate the importance of the\nbody parts that trainees should follow to revise their poses\noptimally. In the future, we plan to conduct user studies to\nevaluate the training effectiveness of the proposed system\nand determine whether the crucial points shown by the atten-\ntion maps can be used in real training scenarios. Moreover,\nwe consider that using a high-quality motion capture sys-\ntem can enhance the solidity of the proposed system with\nhigh-precision human poses despite the high speed of motion,\nsuch as golf swings.\nAs this work focuses on proposing a novel \ufb02ow for con-\nstructing a sports analysis tool, and because user studies may\nvary from domain to domain and are \ufb02exible for the system\ndesigner, further user studies evaluating the proposed sys-\ntem\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency have not been addressed in practice.

However, owing\nto the various timings and speeds of motion of different\nVOLUME 10, 2022 106287\n\npage_label: 106287\nfile_name: AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nC.-C. Liao et al.: AI Golf: Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training\nbe learned in the future, based on their current poses, after\ntraining the network with professional poses. The advantage\nof incorporating machine learning is that the system can learn\nwithout prior knowledge. Therefore, no expert or coach is\nrequired to build such a system, and it can be generalized to\nmany other tasks. In addition, apart from image information,\nmultiple sensors have recently been fused to measure human\nmotion, and deep learning technologies can ef\ufb01ciently take\nadvantage of processing such fused data [9]. However, super-\nvised learning requires abundant data from a speci\ufb01c domain,\nwhich makes it dif\ufb01cult to design a generalized sensor fusion\napplication.\nIn this study, we address these gaps in the literature to\nprovide users with interpretable clues so that they can intu-\nitively understand the difference between themselves and\nprofessional players. We choose golf as our network learning\nsubject because golf is an individual sport, and the player\u2019s\nstanding position is \ufb01xed when performing a swing. Recent\nstudies [10], [11] have demonstrated the ability of deep\nlearning to retrieve \ufb01ne-grained information necessary for\ngolf swing analysis. However, after retrieving the essential\nfactors from human motion, the system designer must know\nwhich part of the body is vital in golf and determine which\nparts must be processed for analysis. Furthermore, the cal-\nculation is manually designed for golf swings; thus, it is\ndif\ufb01cult to generalize the proposed methods to other sports\nanalyses without prior knowledge or the help of experts.\nIn this study, we propose a golf swing analysis tool using\ndeep neural networks to help users recognize the difference\nbetween the user\u2019s swing motion and an expert\u2019s motion\nobtained from the Internet or broadcasted media. Further-\nmore, we address the previous issues in an unsupervised man-\nner to encourage the network to learn standard features from\nprofessional players without adding domain-speci\ufb01c infor-\nmation. Consequently, the proposed network can be applied\nto other sports and skill-training processes.\nThe proposed system consists of three modules: a motion\nsynchronizer, motion discrepancy detector, and motion\nmanipulator. The motion synchronizer matches the two input\nmotions with different timings and speeds. The motion dis-\ncrepancy detector can recognize the difference between the\ntwo motions and \ufb01nd the frame in which the difference\nis large. The motion manipulator is designed to produce\nintermediate motions between the two motions to provide\nmore intuitive instructions for users to learn. To evaluate the\naccuracy and effectiveness of the proposed modules, we col-\nlect golf swing data from existing databases and generate a\npseudo database containing raw video data, 3D pose data,\nand labels for the phases during the swing. Next, we examine\nthe accuracy of the motion synchronizer and the capability of\nmotion discrepancy using three types of inputs (raw video,\nvideo without background, and 3D human pose). Finally,\nwe discuss the accuracy of the results and explain the correla-\ntion among the learned latent space, human motion, and other\nfeatures. On the other hand, qualitative results are shown to\nevaluate the ability of the motion manipulator to reproducemotions from the latent space and create new motions unseen\nin the database.\nFurthermore, we discuss the proposed analytical tool and\nits possible applications in future research. The proposed\napplication visualizes the image frames and human motions\nwhere the discrepancy between the expert and the user\u2019s\nswing is large and helps the user quickly recognize the motion\nthat needs to be corrected. Compared to existing methods,\nthe main contributions of this study can be summarized as\nfollows:\n\u2022A golf swing analysis method and its applications are\nintroduced.\n\u2022The proposed method distinguishes when the difference\nbetween two motions is large and small.\n\u2022The proposed method helps users understand the differ-\nence between themselves and professional players.\n\u2022The proposed method provides intermediate poses that\nare acceptable during the early learning phase of sports.\n\u2022Crucial factors that can in\ufb02uence the accuracy of sports\nanalysis are discussed.\nII.

MOTION MANIPULATOR: DISCOVERING\nINTERMEDIATE MOTION BETWEEN HUMAN POSES\nDuring self-training, it is not always simple for beginners\nto imitate an ideal motion form, which is very different\nfrom their current form. In this study, we propose a motion\ndecoder to generate an intermediate motion. As mentioned\npreviously, the TCC network is trained to learn a latent space\nthat shows motion similarity. Therefore, we understand that\na high-dimensional data point in latent space can be rep-\nresentative of a human pose. To retrieve the intermediate\nmotion between two points in the latent space, we train a\ndecoder using latent vectors to predict human poses that\nare the same as the inputs. In particular, we \ufb01rst input the\ntraining set data into the trained TCC network to obtain the\noutputs of the latent vectors. Next, using the latent vectors\nas inputs, we trained a simple decoder consisting of a single\nfully-connected layer to produce the outputs of the human\nposes. For the loss function LMSE, we take the mean square\nerror (MSE) between the output and input poses:\nLMSE=\u2211\ni||Yi\u2212Xi||2(4)\nwhere Xiis the ithjoint of the input human pose XandYiis\ntheithjoint of the output human pose Y.\nAfter training the motion decoder, we retrieve a new latent\nvector Vinterbetween the two timing-matched latent vectors\nusing linear interpolation:\nVinter=(1\u2212\u03b1)\u00d7V1+\u03b1\u00d7V2 (5)\nwhere V1andV2are the two latent vectors synchronized by\nthe motion synchronizer, and \u03b1\u22080.0,1.0 is the magnitude\nparameter. In the above formulation, by increasing the value\nof\u03b1, we can obtain a human pose whose latent vector is closer\ntoV2, and the restored human pose should ideally be more\nsimilar to the human poses generated from V2.\nIV. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP\nTo evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the three mod-\nules introduced in the previous section, we collected golf\nswing data via the Internet and created a pseudo database\nconsisting of raw video data, without-background-video data,\nand 3D pose data (Figure 4). Next, we implemented three\nmodels of the network (V-TCC, S-TCC, and SA-TCC) uti-\nlizing TCC loss and conducted statistical analysis under four\ndifferent conditions:\n\u2022V-TCC using video inputs with backgrounds\nFIGURE 5.

VIDEO DATASET\nAs the training dataset, we used GolfDB [33], a video dataset\ncollection for all types of golf iron swings and driver swings,\nconsisting of 1400 high-quality golf swing videos of male and\nfemale professional golfers. Although the GolfDB provided\npreprocessed video clips for a frame size of 160 \u00d7160,\nwe rebuilt our pseudo dataset with high-resolution videos.\nIn addition to clean videos, we created another video dataset\nwithout background information. This was because, in our\nhypothesis, the background information, for example, the\nhuman shadow, might in\ufb02uence the alignment of the network.\nMoreover, the network might also learn the motion of props,\nsuch as golf clubs. We used Mask R-CNN [34], a generic\nobject detection and segmentation network, to detect the\nhuman body in a single image frame. We then removed the\nbackground pixels and left only the human body (Figure 4).\nB. 3D POSE DATASET\nTo conduct a more precise analysis of only human poses,\nwe created a new pseudo dataset consisting of 3D point\ndata of human body poses.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What method was used to retrieve the time series of 2D human poses from golf-swing videos in this study?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The method used to retrieve the time series of 2D human poses from golf-swing videos in this study was HRNet."}]}

In addition, instead of directly\nimitating the selected motion, users can gradually imitate\nintermediate human poses using a motion manipulator. Fur-\nthermore, we visualized the attention maps along with the\nself-attention module to demonstrate the importance of each\nbody part (Figure 10). This may be a clue for discovering\nbody parts that should be focused on and what can be ignored.\nTo go a step further, this might indicate the importance of the\nbody parts that trainees should follow to revise their poses\noptimally. In the future, we plan to conduct user studies to\nevaluate the training effectiveness of the proposed system\nand determine whether the crucial points shown by the atten-\ntion maps can be used in real training scenarios. Moreover,\nwe consider that using a high-quality motion capture sys-\ntem can enhance the solidity of the proposed system with\nhigh-precision human poses despite the high speed of motion,\nsuch as golf swings.\nAs this work focuses on proposing a novel \ufb02ow for con-\nstructing a sports analysis tool, and because user studies may\nvary from domain to domain and are \ufb02exible for the system\ndesigner, further user studies evaluating the proposed sys-\ntem\u2019s ef\ufb01ciency have not been addressed in practice. As pre-\nviously mentioned, there are many ways to design a proper\nway to provide feedback to users for training. Related works\nthat use multi-modal feedback to alert users when performing\nthe wrong way compared to professionals have shown their\nsigni\ufb01cance during training. In the future, we plan to combine\nour approach with other feedback systems and evaluate the\neffectiveness of the system. Furthermore, we plan to apply the\nproposed approach to other sports and skill training processes\nto explore the generality of the proposed method.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nWe propose a golf swing analysis tool that uses neural net-\nworks to help users intuitively understand the difference\nbetween themselves and professional players. We divide our\nwork into three parts: synchronization, discrepancy detec-\ntion, and manipulation. First, the motion synchronizer aligns\nmotions with different phases and timings. The experi-\nment shows that our implementation using skeleton inputs\ncan achieve a better performance than state-of-the-art video\nimplementations.\nSecond, using the proposed networks, we use a motion\ndiscrepancy detector to \ufb01nd \ufb01ne-grained differences between\ngolf swings in the latent space. By applying comparative anal-\nysis, such as comparing 3D human poses in those detected\nframes, we conclude that the motion discrepancy detector can\ndistinguish whether the difference between the two motions is\nsmall or large. The proposed SA-TCC network outperforms\nthe previous TCC network in terms of phase classi\ufb01cation\naccuracy and has the best ability to show the correlation\nbetween the distance in the latent space and the MPJPE.\nThird, based on the synchronization and discrepancy detec-\ntion results, we introduce a decoder structure called a motionmanipulator to restore motion from the latent space. The\nrestoration results suggest that the network can retrieve inter-\nmediate human poses between two motions that do not\nexist in the original dataset. Furthermore, instead of teach-\ning beginners directly about professional forms, the motion\nmanipulator can provide them with an intermediate pose that\nis more acceptable for beginners to start with.\nFinally, with the above three main contributions of this\nwork, we create an application for analyzing and visualiz-\ning the discrepancy between two input golf swing motions.\nFor user interaction, users can quickly grasp the difference\nbetween their swings and those of various experts during\nself-training. In addition, by understanding the continuous\nchanges step-by-step between the two selected human poses,\nwe aim to help users ef\ufb01ciently learn an ideal form in a\ngradual manner instead of directly imitating ideal motion.\nUsing the proposed system, users can choose an ideal form\nto imitate and learn to play sports without the help of coaches\nduring self-training. We intend to re\ufb01ne the proposed pro-\ntotype application and conduct user studies to investigate its\neffectiveness.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What is the purpose of the motion discrepancy detector in the AI Golf Swing Analysis Tool?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The motion discrepancy detector in the AI Golf Swing Analysis Tool is used to find fine-grained differences between golf swings in the latent space.

As shown in Figure 7,\na greater correlation and a more clustered distribution were\nfound when the background and golf club were removed from\nthe scene. This indicated that the network could learn the\nmotion features of the club, and that it is essential to analyze\nthe club motion when showing the difference between the two\ninput motions.\nFor the two skeleton models, an over 0.76 Pearson\u2019s corre-\nlation coef\ufb01cient was found when using the SA-TCC. On the\nother hand, only a 0.51 Pearson\u2019s correlation coef\ufb01cient could\nbe obtained from the S-TCC. Therefore, along with the results\nshown in Table 1, we found that although the S-TCC network\nhad the most remarkable performance in tackling synchro-\nnization, its limited ability to detect discrepant motions might\nbe a drawback in terms of real application implementations.\nIn contrast, SA-TCC had a superior Pearson\u2019s correlation\ncoef\ufb01cient over all other competitors while maintaining an\nacceptable phase classi\ufb01cation accuracy.

We then used SA-TCC as\nour \ufb01nal version of the TCC network for the decoder and\napplication implementation, which will be discussed in the\nnext section.\nD. MOTION INTERPOLATION\nFrom the results shown in Figure 9(a), we observed that\nthe trained decoder could restore the ground truth of human\nposes. Furthermore, the motion decoder demonstrated its\nability to generate new human poses unseen in the training\ndataset. This suggested that the TCC network could learn\n\ufb01ne-grained features of the poses of a single person. Notably,\nthe intermediate motion exhibited a continuous change from\none pose to another. From this, We could infer that the human\nFIGURE 10. Visualization of body parts for revision suggestions.

Speci\ufb01cally, intermediate poses had the character-\nistics of two different input human poses. For example,\nwe observed continuous changes in the distance between\nlimbs from one human pose to another. This suggested that\nsimilar poses which pass through the TCC network were\nembedded in nearby points in the latent space regardless of\nthe poses from different individuals.\nFinally, as shown in Figure 9(b), the motion decoder could\ngenerate meaningful intermediate poses at an aligned time.\nWe observed that the human pose gradually changed from an\nabnormal to a standard form. This suggested that instead of\nteaching beginners directly with professionals\u2019 swing forms,\nwe could provide them with a preliminary pose that is more\nacceptable for beginners to imitate.\nVII. APPLICATIONS\nThe proposed method can be used for self-training sys-\ntems that detect discrepant motion frames using the distance\nbetween golf swings in the latent space and compare 3D\nhuman poses at the detected frames.

Next, we implemented three\nmodels of the network (V-TCC, S-TCC, and SA-TCC) uti-\nlizing TCC loss and conducted statistical analysis under four\ndifferent conditions:\n\u2022V-TCC using video inputs with backgrounds\nFIGURE 5.

VIDEO DATASET\nAs the training dataset, we used GolfDB [33], a video dataset\ncollection for all types of golf iron swings and driver swings,\nconsisting of 1400 high-quality golf swing videos of male and\nfemale professional golfers. Although the GolfDB provided\npreprocessed video clips for a frame size of 160 \u00d7160,\nwe rebuilt our pseudo dataset with high-resolution videos.\nIn addition to clean videos, we created another video dataset\nwithout background information. This was because, in our\nhypothesis, the background information, for example, the\nhuman shadow, might in\ufb02uence the alignment of the network.\nMoreover, the network might also learn the motion of props,\nsuch as golf clubs. We used Mask R-CNN [34], a generic\nobject detection and segmentation network, to detect the\nhuman body in a single image frame. We then removed the\nbackground pixels and left only the human body (Figure 4).\nB. 3D POSE DATASET\nTo conduct a more precise analysis of only human poses,\nwe created a new pseudo dataset consisting of 3D point\ndata of human body poses.\n---------------------\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\nQuery: What method was used to retrieve the 3D human poses from golf-swing videos in this study?\nAnswer: "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The 3D human poses from golf-swing videos were retrieved using a simple linear network structure.

However, it is dif\ufb01cult for beginners to specify\nthe keyframes on which they should focus and which part of the body they should correct because of\ninconsistent timing and lack of knowledge. In this study, a golf swing analysis tool using neural networks\nis proposed to address this gap. The proposed system compares two motion sequences and speci\ufb01es\nkeyframes in which signi\ufb01cant differences can be observed between the two motions. In addition, the system\nhelps users intuitively understand the differences between themselves and professional players by using\ninterpretable clues. The main challenge of this study is to target the \ufb01ne-grained differences between users\nand professionals that can be used for self-training. Moreover, the signi\ufb01cance of the proposed approach is\nthe use of an unsupervised learning method without prior knowledge and labeled data, which will bene\ufb01t\nfuture applications and research in other sports and skill training processes. In our approach, neural networks\nare \ufb01rst used to create a motion synchronizer to align motions with different phases and timing. Next,\na motion discrepancy detector is implemented to \ufb01nd \ufb01ne-grained differences between motions in latent\nspaces that are learned by the networks. Furthermore, we consider that learning intermediate motions may\nbe feasible for beginners because, in this way, they can gradually change their pose to match the ideal form.\nTherefore, based on the synchronization and discrepancy detection results, we utilize a decoder to restore\nthe intermediate human poses between two motions from the latent space. Finally, we suggest possible\napplications for analyzing and visualizing the discrepancy between the two input motions and interacting\nwith the users. With the proposed application, users can easily understand the differences between their\nmotions and those of various experts during self-training and learn how to improve their motions.\nINDEX TERMS Computer vision, machine learning, motor skill training, golf.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn sports, it is dif\ufb01cult for beginners to improve their skills\nwithout prior knowledge or assistance from coaches. As a\nconventional method, people go to lessons to meet experts\nand learn how to play in the proper form. However, in most\nsports, players spend considerable time training alone to\nachieve outstanding results in the \ufb01eld and retain exceptional\nbody conditions. Therefore, it is important to design and\nimplement an effective and accurate self-training process for\nsuch situations.\nIn the \ufb01eld of the acquisition of sports skills, one way\nto improve sports skills is to replicate professional players\u2019\nmotions.

To accelerate this process,\nmany systems have recently been developed to help users\nunderstand the movements of professionals [1], [2], [3], [4],\n[5]. However, in these previous works and systems, users may\nstruggle to re\ufb01ne their movement with no idea which timing\nof the whole motion, which parts of the body they should\nfocus on, or how they can change their body movements to\nget their form closer to that of professionals.\n\npage_label: 106294\nfile_name: AI_Golf_Golf_Swing_Analysis_Tool_for_Self-Training.pdf\n\nC.-C.

In addition, instead of directly\nimitating the selected motion, users can gradually imitate\nintermediate human poses using a motion manipulator. Fur-\nthermore, we visualized the attention maps along with the\nself-attention module to demonstrate the importance of each\nbody part (Figure 10).

In their system, users\nreceived visual, haptic, and audio feedback when they did not\nideally move their bodies or instruments. However, the ideal\nmovement could differ from sport to sport, meaning that it\nmay be dif\ufb01cult to generalize these methodologies to other\nsports.\nOn the other hand, another way to learn sports skills is\nimitating professional players\u2019 motions [1], [3], [4], [5].\nIkeda et al. [16] proposed a golf swing training system that\nuses the motions of professional golfers. In their system,\na user\u2019s motion was synchronized with a selected ideal\nprofessional\u2019s motion, and the two motions were overlaid and\nprojected onto the ground during training. Sasaki et al. [17]\nalso reported the importance of beginners copying expert\nmotions and proposed a climbing training system using pose\nprediction.

Thus, building a system that can teach\nusers step-by-step to improve their sports skills remains\nchallenging.\nB.

Liao et al.: AI Golf: Golf Swing Analysis Tool for Self-Training\nbe learned in the future, based on their current poses, after\ntraining the network with professional poses. The advantage\nof incorporating machine learning is that the system can learn\nwithout prior knowledge. Therefore, no expert or coach is\nrequired to build such a system, and it can be generalized to\nmany other tasks. In addition, apart from image information,\nmultiple sensors have recently been fused to measure human\nmotion, and deep learning technologies can ef\ufb01ciently take\nadvantage of processing such fused data [9]. However, super-\nvised learning requires abundant data from a speci\ufb01c domain,\nwhich makes it dif\ufb01cult to design a generalized sensor fusion\napplication.\nIn this study, we address these gaps in the literature to\nprovide users with interpretable clues so that they can intu-\nitively understand the difference between themselves and\nprofessional players. We choose golf as our network learning\nsubject because golf is an individual sport, and the player\u2019s\nstanding position is \ufb01xed when performing a swing. Recent\nstudies [10], [11] have demonstrated the ability of deep\nlearning to retrieve \ufb01ne-grained information necessary for\ngolf swing analysis. However, after retrieving the essential\nfactors from human motion, the system designer must know\nwhich part of the body is vital in golf and determine which\nparts must be processed for analysis. Furthermore, the cal-\nculation is manually designed for golf swings; thus, it is\ndif\ufb01cult to generalize the proposed methods to other sports\nanalyses without prior knowledge or the help of experts.\nIn this study, we propose a golf swing analysis tool using\ndeep neural networks to help users recognize the difference\nbetween the user\u2019s swing motion and an expert\u2019s motion\nobtained from the Internet or broadcasted media. Further-\nmore, we address the previous issues in an unsupervised man-\nner to encourage the network to learn standard features from\nprofessional players without adding domain-speci\ufb01c infor-\nmation. Consequently, the proposed network can be applied\nto other sports and skill-training processes.\nThe proposed system consists of three modules: a motion\nsynchronizer, motion discrepancy detector, and motion\nmanipulator. The motion synchronizer matches the two input\nmotions with different timings and speeds. The motion dis-\ncrepancy detector can recognize the difference between the\ntwo motions and \ufb01nd the frame in which the difference\nis large. The motion manipulator is designed to produce\nintermediate motions between the two motions to provide\nmore intuitive instructions for users to learn. To evaluate the\naccuracy and effectiveness of the proposed modules, we col-\nlect golf swing data from existing databases and generate a\npseudo database containing raw video data, 3D pose data,\nand labels for the phases during the swing. Next, we examine\nthe accuracy of the motion synchronizer and the capability of\nmotion discrepancy using three types of inputs (raw video,\nvideo without background, and 3D human pose). Finally,\nwe discuss the accuracy of the results and explain the correla-\ntion among the learned latent space, human motion, and other\nfeatures. On the other hand, qualitative results are shown to\nevaluate the ability of the motion manipulator to reproducemotions from the latent space and create new motions unseen\nin the database.\nFurthermore, we discuss the proposed analytical tool and\nits possible applications in future research. The proposed\napplication visualizes the image frames and human motions\nwhere the discrepancy between the expert and the user\u2019s\nswing is large and helps the user quickly recognize the motion\nthat needs to be corrected. Compared to existing methods,\nthe main contributions of this study can be summarized as\nfollows:\n\u2022A golf swing analysis method and its applications are\nintroduced.\n\u2022The proposed method distinguishes when the difference\nbetween two motions is large and small.\n\u2022The proposed method helps users understand the differ-\nence between themselves and professional players.\n\u2022The proposed method provides intermediate poses that\nare acceptable during the early learning phase of sports.\n\u2022Crucial factors that can in\ufb02uence the accuracy of sports\nanalysis are discussed.\nII.
